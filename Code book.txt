Code Book

This code book summarizes the resulting data fields in "tidy_dataset.txt"

The tidy_dataset.txt reports the mean and standard deviations values of the features data, listed by subjust ID and acitivity level


Descriptions and Identifiers

The first two columns are Identifiers.

    Subject - The ID of the participants 

    Activity - The type of activity performed by the subject when measurements were taken
         WALKING (level 1): subject was walking during the test
         WALKING_UPSTAIRS (level 2): subject was walking up a staircase during the test
         WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS (level 3): subject was walking down a staircase during the test
         SITTING (level 4): subject was sitting during the test
         STANDING (level 5): subject was standing during the test
         LAYING (level 6): subject was laying down during the test

Measurements

The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. 
These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using 
a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the 
acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using 
another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain 
Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated 
using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, 
fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). 

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

The variables in the "tidy_dataset.txt" are the calculated means (Mean) and standard deviations (Std) of measurements that were taken while subjects 
were performing a defined activity.  Features are normalized and bounded within [-1,1].
